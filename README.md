### Predicting-the-price-of-an-automobile-via-K-nearest-neighbour-algorithm ###


In this project we will be diving into the world of automobiles(cars) with the aim of creating a model that can optimally predict the price of a particular car.
We will we analysing various metrics that are ideally used to measure a cars performance and based on those metrics, we will build a model that endures the lowest error when used against novel data.
